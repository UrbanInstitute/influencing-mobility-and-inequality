        <p>
        Whether we continue our education or whether we take one job over another—these can be critical moments that set us on an upward or downward path of economic mobility.

        <p>
        The options available to people at these crossroads moments and the decisions they make—or that are made for them—are influenced by many things, such as where they live, how much money they have, and what structural barriers they face.

      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <p>
        But what if interventions at these crossroads moments could make a difference early on? What if those differences could change a person’s path?

        We aimed to answer those questions with the <a href = "https://social-genome.org/" target = "_blank">Social Genome Model</a>, a microsimulation tool that can project how changes in adolescence and early adulthood can influence well-being later in life.

  <h2>
  What do all these scenarios tell us?
  </h2>
  <p>They tell us that the cost of structural racism is high, particularly for Black people; interventions early in life can pay off; and progress is possible.</p>
  <p>We urge readers not to compare interventions because they differ in scale and scope and the costs are not precise. Also, no single intervention is a silver bullet, just as no single crossroads moment consistently puts people on a path to better economic mobility.</p>
  <p>But because early interventions ripple through a person’s lifetime, even modest improvements can be meaningful. And combining several approaches could lead to substantial and life-changing differences. What if the country was bold enough to try?</p>

                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>
                      The <a href = "https://social-genome.org/" target = "_blank">Social Genome Project</a> uses the Social Genome Model to explore how policies, programs, and practices focused on young people affect adult outcomes, such as lifetime earnings.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Social Genome Model provides a framework and tool for assessing the long-term effects of social interventions. Structured around developmentally significant periods early in a person’s life, the model can trace the effects of social interventions on outcomes like school performance, educational attainment, and adult earnings. These virtual experiments, or “scenarios,” can provide estimates of the long-term benefits of policies and actions earlier in life as well as the costs of inaction.</p>
                    <p>
                      Because there is no large, nationally representative, longitudinal dataset tracking a relatively recent cohort of children from birth to adulthood, this version of the Social Genome Model is built on a matched panel of individuals we constructed by statistically matching data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97). The ECLS-K provides data for the prekindergarten, early elementary, and middle childhood life stages, and the NLSY97 provides data for the early adolescence, adolescence, transition-to-adulthood, and adulthood life stages. For circumstances at birth, we use retrospective information gathered in both datasets. For details about how we constructed and validated the matched panel, see <a href = "https://www.urban.org/research/publication/understanding-and-quantifying-crossroads-moments" target = "_blank"><em>Understanding and Quantifying Crossroads Moments: How Context and Decisions Can Affect Economic Mobility and Racial and Ethnic Disparities</em></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We use “Hispanic” to refer to people of Latino or Hispanic origin because it is the classification used in the NLSY97 and the ECLS-K. We recognize this term may not be the preferred identifier for many, and we remain committed to using inclusive language whenever possible.
                  </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>Policies, practices, and norms that have created and maintained deep <a href = "https://next50.urban.org/question/structural-racism#structural-racism-promising-solutions" target = "_blank">racial and ethnic inequities</a> are barriers to upward mobility for many.</p>
        <p>Research finds that Black and Hispanic children are more likely than White children to be <a href = "https://www.nap.edu/read/10186/chapter/9" target = "_blank">enrolled in underresourced schools</a>, to <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2465656/" target = "_blank">be exposed</a> to <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546368/" target = "_blank">environmental pollutants</a>, and to <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673502/" target = "_blank">be exposed</a> to <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30139709/" target = "_blank">violence</a> and <a href = "https://www.childtrends.org/publications/prevalence-adverse-childhood-experiences-nationally-state-race-ethnicity" target = "_blank">traumatic experiences</a> and events.

        <h2>How we did it</h2>
        <p>What if society treated Black and Hispanic children the same way it treats White children? What if, from birth, they had the same experiences in school, at home, and in their communities?</p>
        <p>Historical inequities such as segregation and discrimination shape children’s circumstances at birth. Our simulations do not change the circumstances into which children are born; rather, we use circumstances at birth as a starting point and see how much better off Black and Hispanic children would be if, throughout childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, they were treated like their White peers.</p>
